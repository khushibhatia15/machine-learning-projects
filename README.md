#Weather Data Scraping:
This project aimed to gather and analyze historical weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. Data was collected for multiple cities, and various weather parameters were analyzed to identify trends and patterns. The project utilized Python for data retrieval, processing, and visualization, demonstrating the feasibility of using APIs for weather data analysis.
